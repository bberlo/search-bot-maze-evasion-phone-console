Situation / Task

Create an interactive cyber-physical installation that utilizes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm. The interaction must involve some form of hardware like a Kinect, Leap Motion, or camera, but not a mouse. AI algorithms treated in prior course lectures include grid search and MinMax algorithms. 

Action

Implemented streaming of IMU data from a phone console using SensoDuino (https://www.instructables.com/SensoDuino-Turn-Your-Android-Phone-into-a-Wireless/). Implemented grid search logic with OpenFrameworks.

Result
